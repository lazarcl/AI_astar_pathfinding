This program uses pygame for visualization of results. And must be run with python version 2.x

If you wish to change the map, then edit the map.txt file. '-' denote walkable terrain, and '#'s are unwalkable terrain.

To run the program, run main.py with python 2.x
Click with the left mouse button to select the start position. The mouse position will always be the destination, so the program
will continuously update the optimal path from start position to the mouse position; finding the optimal path between the two.
